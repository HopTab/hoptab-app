## Description

Hoptab is an open source browser inspired by ark in order
to offer a simplified and intuitive experience on Windows and Linux

Its tab system is the biggest inspiration of ark because
it is in instance form and pinnable to block the closure

The biggest difference with ark is that the browser is easily controlled with the mouse
and that everything will be based on the tab system whether
it is the settings or the favorites in order to have previews of what we do
